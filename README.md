My GitHub account has two repositories in it; the one that we just made for this class and one from earlier this year in my Game Art Design class with NavMesh data for a Unity project I was working on.
The repository I just created is currently empty save for the README file and I think that it will be plenty full by the end of this semester.
To clone the repository to my desktop I first had to make the repository on the web browser version of GitHub and then download the GitHub application onto my desktop and then navigate to the create menu where I cloned my repository from the web browser to my hard drive.
